# Live Edge Tables: Nature's Signature on Your Furniture

Most furniture hides where it came from. Boards are cut straight, edges squared off, surfaces sanded to uniformity. By the time a tree becomes a table, you'd barely know it was ever alive.

Live edge is different.

When we make a live edge table, we keep the natural outer contour of the tree along one or both sides. That undulating line where the bark used to be? It stays. The organic shape that no machine could produce? That's the point.

It's not for everyone. But for the right person, in the right space, a live edge table is genuinely special.

## What "live edge" actually means

When a tree is cut into boards, the outer edge—the part that was closest to the bark—has an irregular, curved profile. In conventional furniture making, this edge is trimmed away to create straight, predictable sides.

Live edge preserves that natural contour. The table literally retains the shape of the tree it came from.

No two live edges are the same. Each tree grew differently, responded differently to wind and weather, developed its own particular curves and character. When you buy a live edge table, you're getting something genuinely unique—not a design choice repeated across thousands of identical units, but a physical record of one specific tree's life.

## Who live edge suits

Live edge makes a statement. It's not neutral, not invisible, not a background piece. If you're drawn to it, you probably already know. But here's who typically loves living with live edge:

**People who appreciate natural materials.** If you like exposed wood, stone, natural textiles, and organic textures, live edge fits right in. It's furniture that celebrates rather than conceals its origins.

**People who want a focal point.** A live edge dining table or desk commands attention. Guests notice it. You notice it. If you want furniture that sparks conversation and anchors a room, live edge delivers.

**People comfortable with imperfection.** Live edge isn't symmetrical. It's not predictable. If you prefer things neat, matched, and uniform, you might find the organic shape unsettling. But if you see beauty in natural variation, you'll appreciate exactly what live edge offers.

**People with modern-rustic or industrial spaces.** Live edge pairs beautifully with steel, concrete, and minimal design. The contrast between organic wood and industrial materials creates interesting tension. It also works in more traditional settings, but it's never going to look conventional.

## Who might prefer straight edge

There's nothing wrong with preferring clean lines. Straight edge tables:

- Fit more predictably into room layouts
- Offer consistent width along the entire length
- Read as more formal and understated
- Work in spaces where you want the furniture to blend rather than stand out

If you're furnishing a formal dining room, or if your interior style leans toward symmetry and order, straight edge might suit you better. The oak is just as beautiful—the choice is purely about shape.

## Living with live edge

A few practical considerations:

**Width varies.** Because the edge follows the tree's natural contour, a live edge table is wider in some places than others. This is part of the charm, but it means table settings might not line up perfectly symmetrically, and some seats have slightly more or less table space than others.

**Placement matters.** Think about where the live edge will fall. Against a wall, the undulating line creates an interesting visual. Facing into a room, it becomes more of a feature. There's no wrong answer, but it's worth considering.

**The edge needs occasional attention.** Live edges can sometimes develop small splinters or rough spots over time, especially if they haven't been properly finished. Ours are sealed and smoothed, but if you ever notice a rough patch, a light sand and dab of oil sorts it out.

## Our live edge process

Not every board makes a good live edge. We select pieces where the natural contour is interesting without being too wild—enough character to be distinctive, not so much that the table becomes impractical.

The edge is cleaned of any remaining bark (bark looks nice but doesn't stay attached long-term), sanded smooth so you can run your hand along it without catching splinters, and finished with the same oil we use on the rest of the surface.

The result is a table that feels good to use, not just look at. You can sit at any position without worrying about rough edges catching your clothes or scratching your arms.

## What makes each piece unique

We mean it when we say no two are alike. Here's what varies:

**The contour itself.** Some edges curve gently; others have more dramatic undulations. Some have interesting notches or indentations; others flow smoothly.

**Grain patterns.** The grain near the edge often shows interesting figure—swirls and waves where the tree's outer growth rings met the world.

**Colour variation.** Sapwood (the outer wood) is often lighter than heartwood (the inner core). Live edge pieces frequently show this transition, creating natural colour gradients.

**Character marks.** Knots, mineral streaks, small checks—these natural features tend to concentrate near the edges and add to each piece's individuality.

When you order a live edge table from us, you're getting a specific piece of oak with its own specific character. We're happy to send photos before shipping so you know exactly what's coming.

## Making the decision

If you're on the fence about live edge, ask yourself:

Do you want furniture that blends in or stands out? Live edge stands out.

Are you comfortable with natural variation? Live edge celebrates it.

Do you want something no one else has? Live edge guarantees it.

And honestly: are you drawn to it? Sometimes the gut reaction is the right one. If live edge calls to you, there's probably a reason.

We make beautiful straight edge tables too—there's no judgment either way. But if you're looking for something with genuine presence, something that brings nature indoors, something that'll be a talking point for years to come...

Live edge might be exactly what you're after.
