# Live edge solid oak coffee table 80 cm

## Description

There's something special about a table that shows off where the tree ends and the bark begins. This 80cm live edge piece celebrates the natural shape of the oak, with each table being genuinely one of a kind. It's intimate enough for a cosy reading nook or a smaller living space, but substantial enough to make a statement. The kind of table that starts conversations about craftsmanship and nature.
