# Round solid oak dining table with black epoxy inlay 120 cm

## Description

Dinner parties just got interesting. This 120cm round table seats four comfortably, with everyone equally spaced and able to chat across the table. The black epoxy inlay running through the oak is a guaranteed conversation starter. There's something special about round tables. They feel more intimate, more democratic. Everyone's together, not sitting at the head or the foot.
