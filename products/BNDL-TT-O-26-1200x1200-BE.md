# Round solid oak coffee table with black epoxy inlay 120 cm

## Description

This is the showstopper of the living room. A generous 120cm round table that brings people together for coffee, board games, or lazy Sunday afternoons. The black epoxy inlay running through the solid oak creates a striking contrast that catches the light beautifully. Big enough for your favourite books, a plant or two, and still leave room for your morning cuppa. Perfect for larger living spaces or open-plan areas where you want a centrepiece that actually gets used.
