# Why We Work With Solid Wood (And What That Actually Means for Your Table)

When you start shopping for a table, whether for your dining room, your home office, or your living room, you'll quickly notice that product descriptions can be confusing. Oak table. Oak finish. Oak veneer. Oak-look laminate. They all sound similar, but they describe very different things. And that difference matters more than most people realise when they're making a purchase.

We've been working with wood for a long time. Long enough to have seen furniture trends come and go, manufacturing methods change, and a lot of terminology get stretched until it barely means anything anymore. So let's talk plainly about what solid wood actually is, what it isn't, and why we've chosen to build our tables this way.

## What "solid wood" actually means

When we say a tabletop is solid oak, we mean exactly that. If you were to cut through it at any point, you'd see oak all the way through. The surface you touch, the core underneath, the edge—it's all the same piece of timber. In the case of wider tops, several pieces are joined together, but it's still solid oak throughout.

This might sound obvious, but it's worth stating because so much furniture today is built differently.

## The alternatives, explained honestly

Most tables you'll find in furniture stores are made from engineered wood—plywood, MDF, or particle board—with a thin layer of real wood veneer or a printed laminate on top. This isn't necessarily bad. It's a legitimate manufacturing approach that makes furniture more affordable and allows for certain design possibilities.

But there are tradeoffs.

**Veneer** is typically less than a millimetre thick. It looks like wood because it is wood, just a very thin slice of it glued onto a base material. It can be beautiful when new. The problem comes with time and use. When veneer chips or scratches through to the substrate beneath, the damage can't really be repaired. You can't sand it down and refinish it because there's almost nothing there to sand. What you see on the surface is all there is.

**Laminate** is even thinner: a printed image of wood grain on paper or plastic, adhered to a board. It imitates the look but shares none of the properties of actual timber.

**Plywood and MDF** as core materials can be stable, but they don't age the same way solid wood does. They don't develop character. And when they fail—when moisture gets in, when edges start to swell or delaminate—the failure tends to be terminal.

## How solid wood lives differently

A solid wood table earns its marks. The small scratches from years of family dinners, the slight ring from a coffee cup left too long, the subtle darkening that comes from light and air and time—these become part of the piece rather than damage to it. Oak, in particular, has a grain structure that incorporates wear gracefully.

And when something more significant happens—a deep gouge, a stubborn stain, a surface that's simply grown tired after decades—solid wood can be sanded down and refinished. You can take off a thin layer and find fresh wood beneath, ready for another generation of use. Try that with veneer and you'll sand straight through to nothing.

This is the fundamental difference. Engineered furniture is designed to look good at the point of purchase. Solid wood furniture is built to look good for as long as you own it, and for whoever owns it after you.

## Why we've stayed with this approach

We're not going to pretend that working with solid timber is the easy choice. It's slower. The material costs more. Wood needs to be properly dried and acclimatised, which takes time. It requires more skill to work with because solid wood moves and breathes in ways that manufactured boards don't.

But when you've spent years learning how wood behaves—how to select the right boards, how to join them so they stay true over time—it becomes difficult to imagine doing it any other way. There's a reason craftspeople have worked this way for generations. The reason is that it results in furniture that lasts.

We had plenty of opportunity to change our approach. We could have switched to cheaper materials, reduced our prices, competed differently. We chose not to. Because the whole point of what we do—the reason customers come to us instead of a big furniture chain—is that we're offering something those places can't.

## What this means for you

If you're considering one of our tables, you're not just buying something to fill a space in your home. You're buying a piece of furniture that can be used hard, cleaned up, and used hard again. One that can be refinished in fifteen years if you want a fresh look. One that can move with you from your first flat to your family home and still be there for Sunday dinners when your children have children of their own.

That's the promise of solid wood. Not perfection—because real wood has grain variation, small knots, subtle differences from piece to piece. But permanence. Character that builds rather than degrades. And the quiet confidence that comes from owning something made properly.

## The honest maths

A solid oak table costs more upfront than a flat-pack alternative. We won't pretend otherwise.

But consider what you're comparing. The flat-pack table will look fine when you assemble it. In three years, the veneer will be chipping at the corners. In five years, the joints will be loose. In seven years, you'll be shopping for another table.

Our tables are still in use in homes where they were purchased decades ago. Some have been refinished once or twice. Many haven't needed it. Almost all of them are still solid, still beautiful, still being used daily.

When you divide the cost by the years of use, solid wood isn't more expensive. It's dramatically cheaper. It just asks you to pay more upfront.

For a family table that'll see breakfast, homework, birthday cakes, and Christmas dinners for years to come—that seems like a fair trade to us.
