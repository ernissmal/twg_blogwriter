# The Black Epoxy River: What It Is and Why We Use It

If you've been looking at our coffee tables, you've probably noticed something distinctive on some of them: a dark line running through the oak, sometimes following the grain, sometimes cutting across it in unexpected ways. That's our black epoxy inlay, and it's one of our favourite features to talk about.

It's not a defect. It's not a repair. It's a deliberate design choice that turns the natural character of wood into something striking.

## What you're actually looking at

Wood isn't perfect. That's part of what makes it beautiful.

As trees grow, they develop natural variations: knots where branches once were, cracks that form as the wood dries, gaps where the grain separates. In mass-produced furniture, these features are hidden, filled with generic putty, or rejected entirely. The goal is uniformity.

We see it differently.

When we find a beautiful piece of oak with a natural crack or gap, we fill it with black epoxy resin. The result is a bold, contrasting line that follows the wood's natural character. It looks like a dark river flowing through golden oak—hence why some people call this technique "river table" style.

The epoxy doesn't just sit on top. It bonds with the wood, becoming part of the structure. It's completely solid, completely smooth to the touch, and completely waterproof. You can run your finger across it and feel nothing but a seamless surface.

## Why black?

We chose black because it creates the strongest contrast with oak's warm, honey-gold tones. It's dramatic without being garish. It reads as intentional, not accidental. And it works with almost any interior style—from modern minimalist to industrial to contemporary traditional.

Black also ages well alongside oak. As the wood develops its natural patina over time, darkening slightly with light and air, the black epoxy maintains its contrast. The relationship between the two materials stays balanced.

## Craftsmanship, not concealment

Here's what we want you to understand: the epoxy isn't hiding a problem. It's celebrating a feature.

Every crack and gap in a piece of oak tells a story about that particular tree—how it grew, what stresses it encountered, how it dried. Rather than discarding these characterful pieces or trying to make them look "normal," we highlight them.

The process takes time and skill. The epoxy needs to be mixed precisely, poured carefully to fill every void, and then cured fully before sanding. Get the mix wrong and it won't bond properly. Pour too fast and you'll trap air bubbles. Rush the curing and the surface won't finish smooth.

We take our time with this. The result is worth it.

## When to choose epoxy

Not everyone wants the bold statement of black epoxy. Some people prefer the quieter beauty of natural oak without embellishment. Both are valid choices.

**Consider epoxy if:**

You want a conversation piece. Tables with epoxy inlay catch the light differently, draw the eye, and almost always prompt questions from visitors. If you like furniture that has presence and personality, epoxy delivers.

You appreciate the contrast. The interplay between warm wood and cool black creates visual interest that plain surfaces don't have. It's functional art that happens to be a table.

You want something truly unique. Because the epoxy follows natural cracks and gaps, no two pieces are identical. Your table won't look like anyone else's.

**Consider natural oak if:**

You prefer simplicity. There's nothing wrong with letting oak be oak. The grain is beautiful on its own.

Your space is already visually busy. In a room with lots of patterns and colours, a quieter table might work better as a grounding element.

You want maximum flexibility. Natural oak is the more neutral choice if you're unsure about your long-term interior style.

## Living with epoxy

From a practical standpoint, epoxy is easy to live with.

It's waterproof, so spills aren't a concern—the epoxy won't absorb moisture the way untreated wood might. It's hard and durable, resisting scratches about as well as the oak itself. And it cleans the same way: a damp cloth for everyday messes, a bit of mild soap for anything stubborn.

One thing to know: epoxy can be sensitive to extreme heat. Don't put a hot pan directly on the epoxy line (or on the oak, for that matter—use a trivet). But for normal coffee table use—cups, books, plants, remote controls, the occasional plate of biscuits—it's completely carefree.

When it comes time to refinish the oak (which might be years or decades from now), the epoxy will still be there, still solid, still providing that striking contrast. It's a permanent feature of the table.

## A feature, not a fix

Some furniture makers use fillers to hide imperfections and make wood look more uniform. We're doing the opposite. We're taking the unique characteristics of each piece of timber and turning them into design features.

This approach isn't for everyone, and that's fine. We offer tables both with and without epoxy specifically because we know people have different tastes.

But if you're drawn to the idea of furniture that tells a story—that takes something natural and imperfect and transforms it into something beautiful—then our black epoxy pieces might be exactly what you're looking for.

Every river flows differently. Every table is one of a kind.
