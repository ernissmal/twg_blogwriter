# The Humble Coffee Table: Small Piece, Big Impact

Here's something we've noticed over the years: people agonize over their dining tables and sofas, but coffee tables often become an afterthought. Something to fill the space. Something that was on sale. Something that will do for now.

We think that's a mistake.

A coffee table sits at the center of your living room. It's the first thing guests see when they walk in. It's where you rest your feet after a long day (we won't judge), where books and magazines pile up, where Sunday morning coffee happens. For a piece of furniture that gets used this much and seen this often, "good enough" seems like the wrong standard.

## What a coffee table actually does

Think about how you use your coffee table on a typical day. Morning coffee goes there. Maybe breakfast, if you're eating in front of the TV. The remote lives there, along with whatever you're currently reading. When friends come over, drinks and snacks spread across it. Kids use it for coloring. You've probably wrapped Christmas presents on it at least once.

A coffee table needs to be sturdy enough for all of this. It needs a surface that won't show every water ring and scratch. And it needs to look good while doing its job, because unlike a desk tucked in a corner or a dining table that's often covered with a cloth, a coffee table is on display all the time.

This is where solid wood earns its place. The same qualities that make oak ideal for dining tables—hardness, grain that hides wear, the ability to be refinished—apply here too. Maybe even more so, because coffee tables tend to be treated casually. Nobody puts a coaster on a coffee table.

## Size and proportion

Getting the size right matters more than you might think. A coffee table that's too small looks lost in front of a full-sized sofa. Too large and your living room becomes an obstacle course.

The general rule: your coffee table should be roughly two-thirds the length of your sofa. So a 240cm sofa pairs well with a coffee table around 120-140cm long. This creates visual balance and ensures you can actually reach things from either end of the sofa.

Height is equally important. Standard coffee table height is around 40-45cm, designed to be level with or slightly below your sofa cushions. This makes it easy to reach your drink without having to sit forward, and keeps the table from visually blocking the room.

But here's where personal use comes in. If you regularly eat meals at your coffee table, you might prefer something slightly higher, around 50cm, to make the reach more comfortable. If it's purely for decoration and the occasional cup of tea, standard height is fine.

## Shape changes everything

Unlike dining tables, where rectangular is the default and other shapes are variations, coffee tables have genuine variety. And the shape you choose affects how your room functions.

**Rectangular coffee tables** are the classic choice and work well with most sofas. They provide plenty of surface area and their straight edges align naturally with the straight lines of typical furniture arrangements. If your living room is long and narrow, a rectangular table emphasizes that proportion.

**Square coffee tables** suit smaller spaces or sectional sofas where you're sitting on multiple sides. They're democratic—no long side, no short side, everyone has equal access. They also work well in rooms where the furniture arrangement is more circular or informal.

**Round and oval coffee tables** are underrated. They soften a room full of angular furniture. There are no corners to bump into, which matters if you have young children or a tight floor plan. They encourage movement around the room because there's no "correct" side to walk on.

**Irregular or organic shapes** can work in the right setting, but they're risky. Make sure the shape has a reason, not just novelty.

## The solid oak difference

We make our coffee tables from the same solid oak we use for dining tables, and for the same reasons. But coffee tables let the wood speak differently.

With a smaller surface area, a coffee table often comes from a single board or just two boards joined together. This means more consistent grain patterns, a more unified look. You can really see the character of the individual piece of timber.

And because coffee tables are lower, you often see them from above. The grain becomes a visual feature in a way it doesn't with taller furniture. A beautiful piece of oak with interesting figure—the swirls and patterns that occur naturally as a tree grows—can make a coffee table genuinely striking.

We select boards for coffee tables carefully, looking for pieces with character but not so much variation that they become distracting. It's a balance. The table should be interesting enough to notice, calm enough to live with every day.

## Legs and bases

Coffee tables offer more design flexibility than dining tables because the structural requirements are less demanding. A dining table needs to support substantial weight across a large span. A coffee table mostly needs to hold some books and look good doing it.

This means we can play with leg designs. Hairpin legs give a mid-century modern feel. Straight square legs read as more traditional. Angled legs add visual interest without looking fussy. A central pedestal base creates a completely different feel again.

Our steel legs come in various styles precisely because coffee tables are where that variety makes sense. The same tabletop can look completely different depending on its base—industrial with raw steel, warm and classic with powder-coated black, modern and light with something more minimal.

When you order a coffee table from us, think about your existing furniture. What metal finishes are already in the room? What style are you drawn to? The top will be solid oak regardless, but the legs determine whether the piece feels like it belongs in a farmhouse or a downtown loft.

## Living with imperfection

We'll be honest: a coffee table is going to show use. Maybe more than any other piece of furniture you own.

Glasses will be set down without coasters. Books will be slid across the surface. If you have children, there will be crayon incidents. This is the nature of a coffee table's life.

Solid oak handles this better than any alternative. Small scratches blend into the grain. Water marks, if treated reasonably promptly, usually fade. And if the surface eventually gets tired—five years in, ten years in, twenty years in—you can sand it down and refinish it. The table doesn't go to the curb. It gets a fresh start.

We've refinished coffee tables that customers inherited from their parents. Tables that had survived two decades of family life, countless movie nights, several moves between homes. An afternoon of work and they looked beautiful again. That doesn't happen with veneer or laminate. It only happens with solid wood.

## Practical considerations

A few things worth thinking about:

**Storage**: Some coffee tables include shelves or drawers. These can be useful if you have items you want accessible but not visible. But they also make the table visually heavier and more complex. A simple top on legs feels lighter in a room.

**Weight**: Solid oak is not light. A substantial coffee table might weigh 20-25kg or more. This is actually a feature—it won't slide around when you rest your feet on it, and it feels grounded rather than flimsy. But if you move frequently or like to rearrange your room often, consider whether you want something you can easily shift.

**Finish**: We typically finish our coffee tables with hard-wearing oil that penetrates the wood rather than sitting on top of it. This is more forgiving than lacquer (which can chip) and feels more natural to the touch. It does need occasional reapplication—once a year is plenty—but that's a ten-minute job with a cloth and some oil.

## Why this piece matters

We've watched the furniture industry move increasingly toward disposability. Buy cheap, use for a few years, replace when it falls apart or goes out of style. There's a logic to that, we suppose, if you view furniture as essentially temporary.

We don't see it that way.

A coffee table is where you'll sit with friends for years, maybe decades. It's where your children might do homework, where you'll wrap birthday presents, where you'll stack the books you're reading and the magazines you keep meaning to cancel. It becomes part of the furniture of your life, in the most literal sense.

That seems like something worth making properly. Worth making from materials that improve with age rather than degrade. Worth making so it can be fixed if something goes wrong, refreshed when it shows too much wear, passed along to the next generation if you ever decide you want something different.

A solid oak coffee table won't be the cheapest option. But it might be the last one you need to buy.

That sounds like a reasonable trade to us.
