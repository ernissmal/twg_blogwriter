# The Case for Round Tables (And When Rectangular Is Still Better)

Most tables are rectangular. It's so standard that when someone says "table," you probably picture four straight sides and four corners without even thinking about it. Rectangular tables are the default, and defaults exist for good reasons.

But round tables aren't just a quirky alternative. For certain rooms, certain uses, and certain households, they're genuinely the better choice. We make plenty of both, and we've learned when to recommend each.

Let's talk about shape.

## Why rectangular became the standard

Rectangular tables dominate because they solve practical problems efficiently.

Rooms are usually rectangular. Walls are straight. A rectangular table fits naturally against a wall, into a corner, or parallel to the other furniture in a room. The geometry matches.

Rectangular tables scale up easily. Need to seat more people? Make the table longer. A rectangular table for four becomes a table for six becomes a table for eight just by extending one dimension. The form remains the same, just stretched.

Manufacturing rectangles is straightforward. Straight cuts, right angles, standard joinery. This doesn't mean rectangular tables are easy to make well—they're not—but the geometry doesn't add complexity.

And rectangular tables feel orderly. There's a clear head, a clear foot, defined sides. Everyone knows where they're sitting and who's across from them. For formal dining, for business meetings, for situations where hierarchy matters, rectangular delivers clarity.

These are real advantages. For many homes and most dining rooms, rectangular is the right choice. We're not here to argue against it.

But.

## What round tables offer

A round table creates different dynamics. Some of those differences are practical. Some are more subtle. All of them are worth considering.

**No head of the table.** At a round table, every seat is equivalent. There's no position of authority, no "best" chair. This changes how conversations flow. There's no presiding over a round table—there's only participating.

For family dinners, this is often what people actually want. Nobody's in charge. Everyone's equally present. The shape encourages equality in a way that rectangular resists.

**Easier conversation.** At a round table, you can see everyone without turning your head dramatically. You can make eye contact with anyone. Cross-table conversations happen naturally because everyone's roughly the same distance from everyone else.

A rectangular table for eight means the people at opposite corners are far apart, essentially at separate conversations. A round table for eight keeps everyone within comfortable speaking distance.

**No corners.** This matters more than people expect. Corners take up visual space and physical space. They catch hips when you're walking past. They're exactly where toddlers' foreheads are when they're learning to walk.

Round tables are easier to navigate around, easier to slide past in a tight dining room, and less dangerous for small children. The same footprint feels more spacious because there's nothing jutting out.

**Fits square rooms better.** If your dining area is square rather than rectangular—which many open-plan apartments and eat-in kitchens are—a round table often makes more sense than a rectangular one. It uses the space more naturally and leaves even walkways on all sides.

## The capacity question

Here's where round tables have a genuine disadvantage: they don't scale as efficiently as rectangular ones.

A round table needs to be quite large to seat many people. To comfortably seat six, you need a table about 130cm in diameter. For eight, you're looking at 150cm or more. A round table for ten is around 180cm across—that's a lot of table, taking up a lot of room.

And there's a practical limit. Once a round table gets past a certain size, the person across from you is too far away for comfortable conversation. The very advantage of the shape starts to disappear.

For regular dinner parties of eight or more, rectangular is probably still your answer. Round tables shine for smaller gatherings—four to six people is the sweet spot.

## Oval: the compromise that actually works

Oval tables try to combine the best of both worlds, and honestly, they often succeed.

An oval has no sharp corners, so you get the soft, easy-to-navigate shape of a round table. But it extends in one direction, so you get the capacity of a rectangular table. You can seat eight around an oval more easily than around a circle, and you don't lose the sense of everyone being at one table together.

Ovals also fit rectangular rooms better than circles do. A long, narrow dining room that would make a round table look lost can handle an oval beautifully.

The one consideration: oval tables don't have a clear head either. If you want that formal position of authority—if Sunday roast means grandfather carving at the head of the table—an oval might feel too casual. But for most families, most of the time, this is fine.

We make a lot of oval tables. More than you'd expect, probably. Once people consider them seriously, they often realize it's exactly what their space needed.

## How to choose

Here's a simple framework.

**Choose rectangular if:**
- Your room is long and narrow
- You regularly seat more than six people
- You want a clear head-of-table position
- Your furniture is mostly angular and you want the table to match
- You need to push the table against a wall sometimes

**Choose round if:**
- Your room is square or near-square
- You typically seat four to six people
- You want conversation to flow freely
- You have small children (no corners)
- You want the room to feel less formal

**Choose oval if:**
- You want the softness of round with the capacity of rectangular
- Your room is moderately rectangular but not extremely long
- You like the idea of no defined head
- You want something that feels a bit different

There's no wrong answer. All three shapes work well in the right context. The question is which context is yours.

## Solid oak in the round

Making a round or oval table from solid wood is more demanding than making a rectangular one. The curves require different techniques—you can't just make straight cuts and right-angle joints. There's more waste from the boards. More skill involved in getting the edge smooth and consistent.

But the result is worth it. The grain of oak wrapping around a curved edge has a flow that flat-sided tables lack. The eye follows the wood around the table in a way that feels natural and complete.

And from a structural standpoint, round and oval tables in solid oak are incredibly stable. Without corners to catch or edges to warp unevenly, they maintain their shape beautifully over years and decades.

The pedestal bases we use for many round tables create maximum legroom. There's nothing at the perimeter to interfere with chairs—everyone can pull in close and sit comfortably. It's one of the underrated advantages of going round.

## Living with curves

A round table changes a room's feel more than you might expect. Rooms full of straight lines and right angles read as formal and ordered. Introduce a circle and the energy shifts slightly. Things feel more relaxed, more conversational.

This isn't better or worse—it depends entirely on what you want your dining room to be. Some homes call for ceremony. Others call for comfort. The shape of your table contributes to that atmosphere more than almost any other piece of furniture.

If you're uncertain, think about the meals you actually have. Are they leisurely, conversational, everyone-talking-at-once affairs? Round might suit you. Are they more structured, guests-on-best-behavior occasions? Rectangular might be more appropriate.

Or just go with your gut. Furniture shouldn't require analysis. If you're drawn to round, there's probably a reason. Trust it.

## Our recommendation

We've been making tables long enough to have developed opinions, so here's ours:

For most families, in most homes, with typical dining rooms and typical use patterns, an oval or round table deserves more consideration than it usually gets. The advantages are real, and the disadvantages are manageable for groups of six or fewer.

If you're replacing a rectangular table and have never considered an alternative, at least think about it. Mock up the footprint with newspaper on the floor. Imagine walking around it. Picture your usual dinner guests seated at it.

You might decide rectangular is still right. That's fine—we make plenty of those, and they're excellent tables. But you might also realize that the conventional choice isn't automatically the best choice.

Either way, we're here to make whatever shape you decide on. Solid oak, proper construction, built to last decades. The geometry is up to you.
