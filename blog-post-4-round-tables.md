# Straight Edge, Live Edge, Round, and Pillow: Choosing the Right Shape

When you're shopping for a table, the first question is usually size. But shape matters just as much—maybe more. The shape you choose affects how the table fits your room, how it looks in your space, and honestly, how it feels to use every day.

We make tables in several shapes, each with its own purpose. Let's go through them properly.

## The rectangular classics

Most tables are rectangular. There's nothing wrong with that—it's the standard for good reasons. Rectangular tables fit rectangular rooms. They scale up easily for more seating. They push against walls when needed. The geometry just works.

For dining tables and desks, rectangular is what we make. But within that category, there's a choice that changes everything: the edge.

### Straight edge

A straight edge table has clean, uniform sides cut to a consistent line. It's the conventional choice, and conventional isn't a criticism. Straight edges are timeless. They fit into any interior style without demanding attention. They're predictable in the best sense—you know exactly what you're getting.

If you're furnishing a home with mixed furniture, different styles accumulated over years, a straight edge table won't clash with anything. It's a background piece in the sense that it does its job without shouting about it.

Straight edge is also practical. The uniform width means every seat has the same amount of space. Planning your room layout is straightforward because the dimensions are consistent.

### Live edge

Live edge keeps the natural contour of the tree along one or both sides of the table. Where the bark used to be, you get an organic, undulating line that no factory could produce. No two live edge tables are identical—each one reflects the specific tree it came from.

This is a statement piece. Live edge demands attention and becomes a focal point in any room. It suits homes with a natural, relaxed aesthetic. It pairs well with industrial elements, with plants, with spaces that embrace imperfection.

Live edge isn't for everyone. If you prefer things orderly and symmetrical, the irregular edge might bother you. And the varying width means some seats have slightly more or less table space than others. These aren't problems, just characteristics to consider.

We offer live edge for dining tables, desks, and some coffee tables. If you're drawn to it, trust that instinct. The tables have genuine presence.

## Round coffee tables

Round tables work differently than rectangular ones, and coffee tables are where that difference shines.

A round coffee table has no corners. This sounds obvious, but the implications are real. No corners means easier navigation around your living room, especially in tight spaces. No corners means nothing for toddlers to run into at forehead height. No corners means a softer visual presence in a room full of angular sofas and shelving.

Round also creates different social dynamics. There's no "head" of a round table—everyone gathered around it is equal. For a coffee table, where people sit facing each other across the sofa arrangement, this feels natural.

The main consideration with round is size. A round table takes up more floor space than a rectangular table of similar surface area, because the circle extends equally in all directions. Measure your space carefully and make sure you can walk around it comfortably.

## The pillow shape

This is one of our more distinctive offerings, and it deserves explanation.

A pillow-shaped coffee table has four curved sides that bow outward, like a square that's been gently inflated. It's softer than a rectangle but more structured than a circle. The corners exist but they're rounded rather than sharp.

Pillow shape offers an interesting middle ground. You get more surface area than a circle of similar footprint, but without the hard corners of a rectangle. It reads as contemporary without being stark. It's different enough to be interesting, familiar enough not to feel strange.

If you're drawn to something that's not quite traditional but not aggressively modern either, pillow might be worth considering. It works particularly well in living rooms with curved sofas or rounded armchairs—it picks up those shapes without copying them.

## Matching shape to purpose

Different table types suit different shapes for practical reasons.

**Dining tables** are almost always rectangular because that's what dining rooms are. You need to seat multiple people along the sides, and rectangular makes this efficient. Live edge adds character; straight edge keeps things calm.

**Desks** follow similar logic. You sit on one side, your work spreads across the surface, and rectangular gives you the most usable space. Live edge desks are popular with people who want their workspace to feel less corporate—the natural edge is a daily reminder that this isn't a cubicle.

**Coffee tables** have the most freedom. Round works beautifully for social spaces. Pillow offers something distinctive. We also have straight edge and live edge rectangular options. The choice here is more about aesthetic preference and room layout than strict practicality.

## The honest truth about choice

We could tell you that one shape is objectively better than another, but that wouldn't be true. Shape is personal. It depends on your room, your existing furniture, your taste, and how you actually use the piece.

What we can tell you is this: all our tables are built the same way regardless of shape. Solid oak throughout. Proper construction. Built to last decades and be refinished when needed.

The shape determines how it looks and fits your space. The material and construction determine how long it lasts and how well it ages. We've got the second part covered. The first part is your call.

## A practical suggestion

If you're uncertain about shape, try this: cut paper or newspaper to the approximate footprint of each option you're considering. Lay them on the floor where the table would go. Live with them for a few days. Walk around them. See which one feels right in the space.

It sounds simple, almost silly. But furniture is physical. It takes up room. The only way to really know if a shape works is to see it in context, even if that context is just paper on the floor.

We're happy to discuss dimensions, proportions, and what we'd recommend for specific situations. But ultimately, you're the one who'll live with the table. Your instinct about what belongs in your home is probably right.
