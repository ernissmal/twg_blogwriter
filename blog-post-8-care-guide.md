# Caring for Your Oak Table: A Practical Guide

You've invested in a solid oak table. You want it to last. Here's the good news: oak is remarkably low-maintenance. It's been the wood of choice for furniture makers for centuries precisely because it's hard, durable, and forgiving.

That said, a little care goes a long way. Here's everything you need to know about keeping your table looking its best.

## Daily care: keep it simple

For everyday cleaning, a damp cloth is all you need. Not wet—damp. Wipe down the surface to pick up crumbs, dust, and minor spills. Then dry it with a clean cloth.

That's it. Really.

Oak doesn't need special cleaners for routine maintenance. In fact, most furniture polishes and sprays do more harm than good, leaving waxy residue that builds up over time and actually attracts dust.

For sticky messes or more stubborn marks, add a tiny amount of mild soap—washing-up liquid works fine—to your damp cloth. Clean the area, then wipe again with plain water to remove any soap residue. Dry thoroughly.

## Dealing with spills

Spills happen. Coffee, wine, juice, the mysterious substance your toddler just dropped—life involves liquids.

The key is speed. Oak is porous, and while our tables are finished with oil that provides some protection, liquid left sitting can eventually soak in and leave marks.

When something spills:

1. Blot immediately with a clean cloth or paper towel. Don't rub—blotting lifts the liquid out rather than pushing it in.
2. Wipe the area with a damp cloth.
3. Dry thoroughly.

Most spills, dealt with promptly, leave no trace at all. Even red wine, the traditional terror of wooden furniture, usually wipes clean if you catch it quickly.

## Water marks and rings

The dreaded ring from a cold glass or hot mug. They happen despite best intentions.

Fresh water marks often fade on their own as the wood equalises its moisture content. Give it a few days before panicking.

If a mark persists, try this: place a clean cloth over the mark and run a warm (not hot) iron over it briefly. The gentle heat can draw out the moisture causing the discolouration. Check frequently to avoid overdoing it.

For stubborn marks that won't budge, a light application of mayonnaise (yes, really) left overnight can sometimes work wonders. The oils penetrate the wood and help even out the appearance. Wipe clean in the morning.

If all else fails, the mark can be sanded out during refinishing. That's the beauty of solid wood—surface issues are always fixable.

## Oiling your table

Our tables come finished with a penetrating oil that protects the wood while letting its natural beauty show through. Over time—we're talking months to years, depending on use—this oil wears and the wood can start to look dry or dull.

When you notice this, it's time for a refresh.

**What you need:** A good furniture oil. We recommend hard-wax oils designed for oak—Osmo, Rubio Monocoat, or similar products work well. Avoid generic "furniture polish" which sits on top rather than penetrating.

**How to do it:**

1. Clean the surface thoroughly and let it dry completely.
2. Apply a thin coat of oil with a clean cloth, working in the direction of the grain.
3. Let it soak in for 15-20 minutes.
4. Wipe off any excess with a clean cloth. This step is important—oil left pooled on the surface will become sticky.
5. Allow to cure for at least a few hours before use. Overnight is better.

That's it. Once or twice a year is plenty for most tables. High-use areas like a family dining table might benefit from more frequent oiling; a coffee table that sees lighter use might go longer.

## What NOT to do

**Don't use harsh chemicals.** Bleach, ammonia-based cleaners, and abrasive products can damage the finish and the wood itself.

**Don't place hot items directly on the surface.** Always use trivets or mats under hot dishes, pans, and mugs fresh from the kettle. Oak is tough, but extreme heat can scorch and leave permanent marks.

**Don't let water pool.** Wipe up spills promptly. Don't use soaking wet cloths for cleaning. Don't leave damp items (like plant pots without saucers) sitting on the surface.

**Don't drag heavy or sharp objects across the surface.** Lift rather than slide. Oak resists scratches well, but it's not invincible.

**Don't place your table in direct sunlight for extended periods.** UV light will fade and discolour wood over time. If your table is near a window, consider the sun's path throughout the day.

## Scratches and dents

Minor scratches become part of the table's character over time. Oak's prominent grain helps them blend in naturally.

For more noticeable scratches, try rubbing a walnut (the actual nut, meat exposed) along the scratch. The oils can help disguise minor damage surprisingly well.

Deeper scratches or dents can be addressed during refinishing, or sometimes by "steaming out"—placing a damp cloth over the dent and applying heat with an iron. The moisture swells the compressed wood fibres back toward their original position.

If you're uncomfortable attempting repairs yourself, any good furniture restorer can help. Solid wood is always repairable—that's one of its greatest advantages.

## When to refinish

Eventually—and we're talking years or decades for a well-cared-for table—the surface may get tired enough that oiling alone doesn't restore it. Accumulated scratches, worn areas, stubborn stains, or just a general dullness that won't shift.

That's when you consider refinishing.

Refinishing means sanding down the top layer of the wood (removing old finish and a thin amount of timber) and applying fresh oil. It's not complicated, but it does require some tools and patience. Many people hire professionals; others enjoy it as a weekend project.

The result is a table that looks nearly new. The grain reveals fresh colour, scratches disappear, stains vanish. It's one of the most satisfying aspects of owning solid wood—the ability to genuinely renew rather than replace.

We know of tables that have been refinished two or three times over 30+ years and are still going strong. That's not unusual for solid oak. It's normal.

## The bottom line

Oak doesn't ask much. Keep it clean, deal with spills promptly, oil it occasionally, use common sense about heat and water.

In return, it'll look beautiful for decades. It'll develop a patina that tells the story of your family's life around it. And when it finally needs more attention than routine care, it can be made new again.

That's the deal with solid wood. A little care, a lifetime of use.
