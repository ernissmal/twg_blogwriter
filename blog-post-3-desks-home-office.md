# Your Desk Is Where You Do Your Work. It Should Work For You.

Something changed in the last few years. The desk went from being office furniture—something your employer provided, functional and forgettable—to being one of the most important pieces in your home.

If you're working from home, even part-time, you're spending more hours at your desk than at your dining table. More hours than on your sofa, probably. Eight hours a day, five days a week, fifty weeks a year. That's two thousand hours annually with your forearms resting on whatever surface you chose to work at.

Shouldn't that surface be good?

## The problem with most home office furniture

Walk through a furniture store's home office section and you'll find two categories: expensive executive furniture designed to look impressive in corner offices, and budget flat-pack desks that prioritize price above everything else.

The executive furniture is built for status, not function. Deep glossy finishes that show every fingerprint. Complicated drawer systems you'll never use. Styling that looks important but doesn't actually help you work.

The budget stuff is worse. Particle board with a thin laminate surface, already starting to chip before you've finished assembling it. Wobbly legs. Drawer slides that stick. Surfaces that swell when they meet humidity and show every scratch.

Neither category is designed for someone who actually works at their desk every day. Neither acknowledges that a desk is a tool, and tools should be built to last.

## What we think a desk should be

A good desk needs to do three things: provide a stable, comfortable surface to work on; fit the space you have available; and last long enough that you're not shopping for another one in three years.

That's it. Not complicated. And yet surprisingly hard to find.

Solid oak handles all three. The surface is hard enough to resist the daily wear of keyboards, notebooks, coffee cups, and all the small items that accumulate on a working desk. Oak doesn't dent from a dropped stapler or scratch from a sliding laptop. It develops character over time, yes, but character is different from damage.

Stability comes from weight. A solid oak desk doesn't wobble. It doesn't shift when you lean on it. It doesn't flex when you're writing longhand or shake when you're typing aggressively on a deadline. The mass of real timber provides an anchor that particle board simply can't match.

And longevity is where solid wood really separates itself. When the surface eventually shows enough wear to bother you—and we're talking years, probably decades—you can sand it down and refinish it. The desk isn't disposable. It's repairable.

## Sizing a desk for real work

Desk size seems straightforward until you actually think about how you use one.

The standard recommendation is 120-150cm wide and 60-75cm deep. That's enough for a monitor, keyboard, and some working space. It's fine for occasional use.

But if your desk is where you spend your working life, consider going larger. 160-180cm gives you room to spread out documents, keep reference materials at hand, or add a second monitor. 80cm deep means you can push your monitor back to a comfortable viewing distance without the keyboard hanging off the front edge.

Don't forget about what goes under the desk. If you're using a desktop computer rather than a laptop, you need floor space for the tower. If you use a filing cabinet or storage unit, it needs to fit. Measure your chair's footprint when pushed back from the desk—that's your minimum clearance requirement.

And measure your room carefully. A desk that's too large for the space makes everything feel cramped. But a desk that's too small forces you to work in a way the space didn't require.

## Height matters more than you think

Standard desk height is around 73-76cm. This works for most people of average height using a standard office chair. But "most people" might not include you.

If you're taller or shorter than average, if you use a non-standard chair, or if you have any kind of back or shoulder issues, height becomes critical. Working at a desk that's even a few centimeters too high or low can cause real discomfort over an eight-hour day, and real damage over months and years.

We can make desks at custom heights. It's not complicated on our end—we're already cutting the legs to length. If you know you need something different, just ask.

A proper ergonomic setup has your forearms parallel to the floor when typing, with your shoulders relaxed. That's the height you're aiming for. Sit in your chair, position yourself as you would while working, and measure from the floor to your elbow. That's your ideal desk height, approximately.

## The debate about standing desks

We get asked about standing desks regularly. The research is mixed—standing all day isn't actually better for you than sitting all day. Movement is what matters. The best setup is one that lets you alternate between positions.

If you want a standing desk, you have two options: a fixed-height standing desk (typically around 105-110cm tall), or an adjustable desk that moves between sitting and standing heights.

We make fixed-height standing desks from solid oak. They're simple, stable, and will last forever. If you know you want to stand, and you'll use a separate sitting area when you need to rest, this is a good solution.

Adjustable desks are more complicated. The mechanisms that raise and lower them add points of failure, require electrical components, and have weight limits that solid oak can exceed. If you want adjustability, we'd honestly suggest a lighter top material. This is one area where our traditional approach doesn't serve the application well, and we'd rather tell you that than sell you something that won't work properly.

## Why oak works for desks

We've talked about oak in other contexts—its hardness, its grain, its aging properties. For desks specifically, there are a few additional considerations.

Oak has a warmth that makes it pleasant to work at. The cool, sterile surface of glass or laminate doesn't invite you to settle in for focused work. Wood does. There's something about the natural material that makes a workspace feel less like an office and more like a place where good work happens.

The grain provides subtle visual interest without being distracting. You don't want your desk to demand attention when you should be concentrating on the screen. Oak is interesting enough to appreciate, calm enough to ignore when you need to.

And oak develops a personal patina over time. The spot where your wrists rest will burnish slightly. The area under your coffee cup will darken. These aren't flaws—they're evidence of use, and they make the desk yours in a way that manufactured surfaces never become.

## Cable management and practical realities

Modern work involves electronics, and electronics involve cables. Lots of cables. Power cables, monitor cables, charging cables, ethernet cables if you're sensible about your internet connection. Any desk designed for actual work needs to acknowledge this.

We drill cable management holes on request. A simple grommet in the back corner keeps power strips and plugs out of sight while providing easy access. Multiple holes allow more complex setups with cables running to specific locations.

Some people prefer a cable tray mounted under the desk—a simple metal or mesh channel that holds power strips and excess cable length. We don't make these ourselves, but we can tell you what works well with our desks.

The key is to think about this before your desk arrives. Where will your computer live? Where do you want your monitor positioned? Where will you charge your phone? Planning the cable routing in advance saves frustration later.

## Drawers, shelves, and storage

Here's our honest opinion: most desk drawers are clutter collectors. People fill them with things they don't need, then never open them again.

A desk's job is to provide a work surface. Storage can happen elsewhere—in a separate filing cabinet, on shelves, in a credenza behind you. When storage is attached to the desk, it often interferes with legroom or adds visual bulk that makes the desk feel heavy in the space.

We can add drawers to our desks if you want them. But we'd encourage you to think carefully about whether you need them at your workspace, or whether you're just assuming desks should have drawers because they always have.

The cleanest, most functional desks are often the simplest: a solid top, well-proportioned legs, and nothing else to get in the way.

## The investment calculation

A solid oak desk costs more than a flat-pack alternative. Let's be direct about that. But consider the calculation differently.

A cheap desk lasts three to five years before it's falling apart. Scratched surfaces, wobbly joints, drawers that don't close properly. By year five, you're shopping again.

Our desks are built to last decades. We have customers using desks we made twenty years ago. Some have been refinished once. Most haven't needed it. All of them are still solid, still stable, still pleasant to work at.

If you're working from home indefinitely—and many people now are—the desk is an investment in every working day for the foreseeable future. That's a different calculation than buying furniture you'll use occasionally.

Divide the cost by the years of use and solid wood isn't more expensive. Divide it by the hours of use and it's practically free.

## Making the choice

If you're setting up a home office, or upgrading from whatever improvised surface you've been using, we'd encourage you to think about your desk the way you think about your chair or your monitor—as equipment that matters.

You'll spend more time at your desk than almost anywhere else in your home. You'll do work there that pays your bills and maybe defines your career. You'll sit there on good days and bad days, focused days and scattered days, for years to come.

That seems like something worth getting right.

We make desks that will still be solid when you retire from whatever you're doing now. That will look better in ten years than they do today. That will be refinished and used by whoever comes after you, if you ever decide you want something different.

A desk built for how you actually work, from materials that deserve your time.

That's what we think a home office deserves.
