# The Dining Table as the Center of Everything

There's a reason people say "gather around the table" and not "gather around the sofa." The dining table has always been the place where the important things happen. Not just meals, though those matter too. Conversations. Homework. Late-night card games. The kind of moments that, years later, you realize were the ones that counted.

We've been making dining tables for a long time. Long enough to know that when someone invests in a proper one, they're not just buying furniture. They're creating a place for their life to happen around.

## What makes a dining table different

A dining table works harder than almost any other piece of furniture you own. Think about what it endures in a single week: hot dishes, cold glasses leaving condensation rings, elbows, spills, the occasional stack of mail that somehow never gets moved. Children doing craft projects with glitter and glue. Adults doing taxes with coffee and frustration.

This is why material matters so much here. A dining table built from solid oak isn't just about aesthetics (though a beautiful table certainly doesn't hurt). It's about having a surface that can take real use without falling apart.

We've seen our tables come back to us after fifteen, twenty years of family life. Scratched, yes. Showing their history, absolutely. But structurally sound and ready for a light sanding and fresh finish that makes them look nearly new. You can't do that with veneer. You can't do that with laminate. When those materials wear through, they're finished.

## Choosing the right size

The most common question we get about dining tables is about size, and it's worth taking seriously. A table that's too small feels cramped; too large and your dining room becomes an obstacle course.

Here's a practical starting point: allow about 60cm of table width per person. A table that's 180cm long comfortably seats six. At 220cm, you're looking at eight. If you regularly host larger gatherings, consider 240cm or more.

But don't just measure for chairs. Think about how you actually use the space. Do you need to walk around the table to reach the kitchen? Is there a doorway that swings into the room? We generally recommend at least 90cm between the table edge and the wall or nearest furniture, more if the space sees a lot of traffic.

And here's something people often forget: the table's width matters too. Standard dining tables are around 90-100cm wide. This gives enough room for place settings on both sides with serving dishes in the middle. Go narrower and meals become a logistics problem. Go wider and conversation across the table starts requiring raised voices.

## The shape question

Rectangular tables are the classic choice for dining, and for good reason. They're efficient with space, work well in most rooms, and scale up easily for larger gatherings. If you have a long, narrow dining room, rectangular is almost certainly your answer.

We offer two edge styles that change the character significantly:

**Straight edge** tables have clean, uniform sides. They're classic, predictable in the best way, and fit naturally into most interiors. If you want something timeless that won't clash with whatever furniture you buy next, straight edge is the safe choice.

**Live edge** tables keep the natural contour of the tree along one or both sides. No two are identical. The organic shape adds character and makes each table genuinely one-of-a-kind. Live edge suits homes with a more relaxed, natural aesthetic—it's a statement piece rather than a background one.

Both are solid oak throughout. The difference is purely visual, a matter of taste rather than quality.

## Why oak, specifically

We work with several wood species, but oak remains our most popular choice for dining tables, and that's not by accident.

Oak is hard. Technically speaking, it scores around 1360 on the Janka hardness scale, which measures resistance to denting. For context, pine is around 690. This matters when you're talking about a surface that will have things dropped on it, dragged across it, and generally subjected to the chaos of daily meals.

Oak also has a pronounced grain that gives it character and helps it hide the minor scratches that inevitably accumulate. A scratch on a plain, uniform surface stands out. A scratch on figured oak becomes part of the pattern.

And oak ages beautifully. Fresh-cut oak has a light, almost honeyed color. Over years of exposure to light and air, it deepens to a richer, warmer tone. This isn't damage or deterioration. It's the wood settling into itself, developing the patina that makes antique furniture so appealing.

## The legs matter more than you think

We spent a lot of time finding the right partner for our steel table legs, and here's why it mattered: the base of a table isn't just structural. It affects how the table looks, how stable it feels, and critically, how usable the seating is.

The worst dining tables are the ones with legs in the corners that interfere with chairs. You've sat at them. Everyone has. The leg is right where your knee wants to be, and you spend the whole meal slightly twisted.

Our leg designs prioritize two things: stability and clearance. The table shouldn't wobble, even on imperfect floors. And there should be nothing preventing you from sitting comfortably at any point around the edge.

This is particularly important with longer tables. A 240cm tabletop with legs only at the far corners will flex in the middle over time. It needs central support. But that support needs to be designed so it doesn't create dead zones where no one can sit.

## An investment that makes sense

A solid oak dining table costs more than a flat-pack alternative. We won't pretend otherwise. But consider what you're comparing.

The flat-pack table will look fine when you assemble it. In three years, the veneer will be chipping at the corners. In five years, the joints will be loose. In seven years, you'll be shopping for another table.

Our tables are still in use in homes where they were purchased as wedding gifts thirty years ago. Some have been refinished once or twice. Many haven't needed it. Almost all of them are still solid, still beautiful, still being used daily.

When you divide the cost by the years of use, solid wood isn't more expensive. It's dramatically cheaper. It just asks you to pay more upfront.

## What we'd want you to know

If you're considering a dining table from us, here's our honest advice:

Take your time measuring your space. Live with the measurements for a week before ordering. It's much easier to get this right before the table arrives than after.

Think about your actual life, not your aspirational life. If you host large dinner parties twice a year, don't buy a table sized for twelve. If you have young children, consider rounded corners.

Don't be afraid of wood showing character. Those small variations in grain, the occasional knot, the subtle differences from one board to the next—that's not imperfection. That's proof you're getting real timber, not a manufactured imitation.

And if you have questions, ask us. We've been doing this long enough to have seen most situations, and we'd rather help you find the right table than sell you the wrong one.

The dining table is where your family will gather for years to come. It's worth getting right.
