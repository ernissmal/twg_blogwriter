# Choosing Table Legs That Match Your Home

Here's something that surprises a lot of people: the legs can change a table's entire character.

The same solid oak top can look industrial or traditional, minimalist or decorative, bold or understated—depending entirely on what's holding it up. When you're choosing a table from us, the legs are part of the decision. And it's worth getting right.

We partner with GJ Steel & Wood for our table bases and legs. They're specialists in steel furniture components, and their range gives you genuine choice about how your table will look and feel in your space.

Let's walk through the options.

## Paired legs vs pedestal bases

The first decision is structural: do you want two separate leg frames at each end of the table, or a single central pedestal?

**Paired legs** (sold as a set of two) sit at either end of the tabletop. They're the classic choice for dining tables and desks. The advantages: they're inherently stable, they give you unobstructed seating along the sides of the table, and they create a clear, symmetrical look.

**Pedestal bases** use a single central support. They're our standard choice for round and square coffee tables because they maximise legroom—there's nothing at the perimeter to interfere with how you position your seating. Pedestals also work beautifully for smaller dining tables where you want flexible seating around the entire edge.

Neither is better. It depends on your table shape and how you plan to use it.

## Leg styles explained

Within those two categories, there's variety. Here's what we offer:

### For dining tables and desks

**Square Legs** are exactly what they sound like: clean, straight, no-nonsense. They're our most affordable option and work in almost any setting. If you want the legs to recede and let the oak tabletop be the star, square is a solid choice.

**X-Style Legs** form an X shape when viewed from the end of the table. They add visual interest without being fussy—geometric, modern, but not aggressively so. These are probably our most popular choice for dining tables.

**Diamond Legs** have an angular, faceted profile that catches light interestingly. They're more decorative than square or X-style, suited to spaces where you want the base to contribute to the table's presence.

**Square FOURY** adds a decorative cross-beam detail to a square frame. It's traditional enough to suit period properties but clean enough to work in contemporary spaces too.

**Pear Half Legs** have a distinctive organic curve—wider at the bottom, tapering toward the top. They're unconventional and eye-catching, good for spaces where you want something that doesn't look like everyone else's table.

### Pedestal bases for dining tables

**Spider Base** has legs that radiate outward like, well, a spider. It's stable, distinctive, and keeps the floor space relatively open. Works for round and square tops.

**Cross Base** is exactly what it sounds like: an X-shaped base when viewed from above. Clean, symmetrical, good for round or square tops.

**Pear Base** brings the organic Pear shape into a pedestal format. More sculptural than the geometric options.

### For coffee tables

**Round Coffee Base** is a simple pedestal designed specifically for coffee table heights. It works with our round and pillow-shaped tops, keeping the floor space open and the look clean.

**Small Cross** is a scaled-down version of the dining Cross Base, proportioned for coffee tables.

**Small Star** bases (available in different sizes) have multiple radiating legs for extra stability while maintaining an open, airy look.

## Matching legs to your interior style

Here's some honest guidance on what works where:

**Modern minimalist spaces** do well with simple, geometric legs. Square or X-Style in black powder-coat won't compete with clean lines and neutral palettes.

**Industrial interiors**—exposed brick, metal accents, concrete floors—can handle bolder leg designs. The raw steel look pairs naturally with solid wood. X-Style or Spider bases feel at home here.

**Traditional or period homes** might suit Square FOURY or Pear styles, which have enough character to complement rather than clash with ornate surroundings. These legs have presence without looking like they belong in a different era.

**Eclectic, maximalist spaces** can honestly handle anything. If your home is already a mix of styles and periods, the legs become another layer of interest rather than a jarring contrast.

When in doubt, simpler tends to be safer. The oak tabletop will always be the main event. Legs that don't demand attention give you flexibility as your space evolves.

## The stability question

All our leg options are engineered to be stable. That's non-negotiable—nobody wants a wobbly table.

But some configurations are inherently more stable than others. Paired legs at each end of a table distribute weight naturally. Pedestal bases require careful engineering to prevent tipping, which is why our pedestal options have wide footprints.

For longer dining tables (200cm and up), we recommend paired legs. The span is too great for a single pedestal to support comfortably over time. For smaller tables and coffee tables, pedestals work beautifully.

## Colour options

Our steel legs typically come in matte black powder-coat, which is durable, easy to maintain, and works with almost everything. Some styles are available in raw steel finish for a more industrial look—this will develop a natural patina over time if left untreated.

If you have specific colour requirements, get in touch. Custom powder-coating is sometimes possible depending on the order.

## Making the choice

Here's our practical advice:

Look at the metal already in your room. Door handles, light fixtures, other furniture legs. Matching finishes creates cohesion. Contrasting finishes can work too, but it's a more deliberate design choice.

Consider the table's purpose. A family dining table that needs to seat six comfortably has different requirements than a compact desk or a decorative coffee table. Function first, then aesthetics.

Trust your instincts. If you're drawn to a particular leg style, there's usually a reason. The same oak top is available with different bases—the only limit is what appeals to you.

And if you're genuinely unsure, our default pairings are designed to work. We've matched legs to tops based on proportion, style, and balance. The suggested combinations aren't arbitrary—they're what we think looks best.
